    <h2>Our Passion</h2>
    <p>Welcome to <strong>Legends of the Game</strong>, a tribute born from the heart of true sports enthusiasts. Our team shares one thing above all else: an unwavering love for the thrill, artistry, and drama that only sports can deliver.</p>

    <h3>The Story Behind the Site</h3>
    <p>Growing up, each of us was captivated by different moments. Some of us watched Michael Jordan defy gravity, others stayed up late to see Messi weave through a wall of defenders, and a few even dreamed of stepping into an MMA cage. No matter our backgrounds, sports gave us heroes to admire, stories to share, and lessons that shaped who we are.</p>
    <p>This website is our digital arena, a place built to honor the athletes who inspired us and millions around the globe. It's more than stats or highlight reels. It's about the legends; their greatest moments, their impact, and the enduring connections they create.</p>

    <h3>Meet the Team</h3>
    <p>We’re Mariam, Yuchen, Lavanya, and Ajibola, united by our passion for sports and design. From basketball courts to soccer fields and MMA rings, our diverse interests fuel our creation of <strong>Legends of the Game</strong> to honor the athletes inspiring us.</p>
